# Simple Calculator

## Overview

This simple calculator project was created as a means to enhance my coding skills, employing a combination of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. While I acknowledge that there might be room for improvement (and a bit of humor in the code smells department ðŸ˜‚), the goal was to learn and grow through practical implementation.

## HTML Consideration

One challenge I encountered in the HTML file was deciding how to pass values to JavaScript. I opted for the approach of using function parameters, deeming it a straightforward method for building the interaction between the two languages.

## JavaScript Challenges and Solutions

### Backspace Functionality

Implementing the backspace functionality posed an interesting challenge. With the help of online resources, I was able to address this issue and integrate a seamless backspace feature into the calculator.

### Handling Keydown Events

Understanding and managing keydown events was another aspect I delved into. By leveraging resources such as YouTube videos and Stack Overflow, I gained insights into handling key events efficiently.

### Preventing Default Keydown Events

To prevent default keydown events, I explored various techniques. The eventual solution helped create a smoother user experience by ensuring that unwanted default behaviors were intercepted and handled appropriately.

## CSS Styling

In the realm of CSS styling, the challenge wasn't so much about problems as it was about making aesthetically pleasing color choices. While I may not have found the perfect solution for this, I invite contributors and fellow developers to share their insights on creating visually appealing color schemes.

## Conclusion

This simple calculator project is a testament to my ongoing journey of skill development and exploration. Feel free to explore the code, offer suggestions, and let's continue to learn and grow together! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
